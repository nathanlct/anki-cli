# [WIP] anki-cli

A command line interface for studying and managing *Anki* decks from a terminal.

## Installation

- Install the Anki plugin [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159). It can be done directly in Anki by going into **Tools > Add-ons** in the menu bar, selecting **Get Add-ons...** and entering the code **2055492159**. Once this is done, press **OK** and restart Anki. These installation instructions can be found in more details on [AnkiConnect's github](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect), as well as notes for Windows and Mac OS X users.

- Install the Python 2 package `urllib2` by running the following command: `pip install urllib2`.

## Usage

- Launch *Anki* and leave it open in the background.
- Run the `main.py` script by executing the following command: `python main.py`.
- Wait until the synchronization with *AnkiWeb* is done and your decks are displayed, then type `help` after the `>>>` prompt to see the commands available to you.
